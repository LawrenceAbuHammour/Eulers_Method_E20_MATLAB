# Eulers_Method_E20_MATLAB
In my final major programming experience in the Engineering Sciences 020 course at Dartmouth College and the Thayer School of Engineering, I programmed a basic differential equation solver that uses Euler's Method to plot the solution of the differential equation. This program uses other functions as a means of producing the various plots. The solver was an exercise in basic MATLAB programming, script and functions in MATLAB, arrays as matrices, user-input and interaction, and plot production. Make sure to download all files into one folder for the program to run properly. Published during the Spring of 2016In my final
